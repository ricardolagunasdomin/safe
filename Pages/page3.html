        <h1>Crystal Castles</h1>
        <section>
        <p>Crystal Castles is one of the most known electronic bands from the early 2000's. When they first started the band consisted of Alice Glass (Margaret Osborn) and Ethan Kath (Claudio Paolo Palmieri). They are seen as the band that started/expanded the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_house_(genre)" target="_blank">Witch House</a>" genre. </p>
        <p>They started in Toronto, Canada planning to just perform at house parties but later their music spread, and the people wanted more music from them after they released their "<a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/album/alice-practice" target="_blank">Alice Practice</a>" EP contianing thier hit song "<a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/track/alice-practice-2" target="_blank">Alice Practice</a>". Their label wanted them to release a full length project which would go on to become their self titled album "<a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/album/i" target="_blank">Crystal Castles</a>" aka (I). This project is what propeled them to such great heights, the track that caught the most peoples ears form this album was the track "<a href="" target="_blank">Crimewave</a>".</p>
        <p>Two years after their major success with their first EP and Album as Crystal Castles they release "<a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/album/doe-deer" target="_blank">Doe Deer</a>" (April 17, 2010) an EP containing 5 tracks. This was followed a month after by their second album titled <a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/album/ii" target="_blank">(II)</a> on May 24, 2010 with fan favoirte tracks such as "<a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/track/celestica" target="_blank">Celestica</a>" and "<a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/track/baptism" target="_blank">Baptism</a>".</p>

            <p style="height: 150px; width: 450px;" >For Alice and Ethan's final album together they released "<a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/album/iii" target="_blank">(III)</a>" (on November 7, 2012) a very soft and smooth album compared to their earlier work. With a beautiful last track "<a href="https://crystalcastles.bandcamp.com/track/child-i-will-hurt-you" target="_blank">Child I Will Hurt You</a>" they close out their final project together, two Years after said release we see Alice's departure from the band. This saddened many people but this was for a good reason, three years after her leave from the band in 2017 she shared with the world that her former partner Ethan Kath (Claudio Paolo Palmieri) had psychological, physical, and sexually abused her during her time in Crystal Castles. (Mind you she was 15 when they first formed Crystal Castels and he was around 25. I will not be getting further into detail about such a sensitive topic.)</p>
