        <h1>Destroy Lonely</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Destroy Lonely (Bobby Sandimanie III) critically acclaimed “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/loneylone/sets/underworld" target="_blank">Underworld.</a>” is mainly produced by a group called UwO(Underworld Online). On the SoundCloud version of this album on the track “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/loneylone/expiration-date-prod-clayco?in=loneylone/sets/underworld" target="_blank">Expiration Date</a>”, Bobby shows his more vulnerable side stating “ Where my lil soul go ? Damn she got it “ this shows that Bobby is giving us(the listener) a view into his current love life.</p>
            <p>He also goes on to state, "Cause this lil heart of mine seem like it's finna be expired”. This shows that his current feelings seem rather broken and don't seem to be doing too well. This song is truly emotional paired with the production from “<a href="https://genius.com/artists/Clayco" target="_blank">Clayco</a>”; the violin truly brings out the best from Destroy Lonely. This entire album is stellar but this track itself carries a lot of weight and meaning behind it.</p>
            <p>On the intro track to the album titled “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/loneylone/online-prod-clayco?in=loneylone/sets/underworld" target="_blank">Online”</a>, we get to hear the amazing production from producer “Clayco”. Along with Destroy Lonely's amazing vocals, it is a match made in heaven. On this track Destroy Lonely shows the struggle stating “ I don't think you could walk a mile in my shoes”. Destroy Lonely is showing the struggle he had to go through to get to where he is now. But on the flip side he shows how it is on the other side of the coin stating “and this sh*t so easy, I don't know what to do”.Destroy Lonely had reached his form of success now and it must be hard going from struggling to being a well-known person in the “underground”.</p>

            <p>On another stand-out track “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/loneylone/kool-prod-clayco?in=loneylone/sets/underworld" target="_blank">Kool</a>” it shows a more melodic side of Destroy Lonely. Such as the way he elongated “two”. This track also showcases his love for the Japanese brand “Undercover”.He also mentions other brands such as “(N)umber Nine “ and “Rick Owens”. He certainly shows his love for clothes and designer brands in this song.</p>
            <p>Destroy Lonely is known for his love for designer brands, this can be heard in songs such as in "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/hitech-stef/destroy-lonely-its-up-kp-beatz" target="_blank">It's Up</a>" where he states "I gotta fetish, for designer clothes" showing his connection to this high fashion can be described as an attraction.</p>
            <p>Another song where he talks about said clothes are in "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/diorpurses/destroy-lonely-suicide-mission" target="_blank">Ari/Suicide Mission</a>" where goes on to say "Givenchy, Versace, bought her Dior, Margiela. Put Chanel on her sweater. She wants whatever, whichever. I do whatever whenever. She like me, she says I'm clever. B****, I Saint Laurent my leather" he is not only showing us (the listeners) yet again his love life talking about how he is going to buy his mistress these luxury brands. But he also talks about how she is attracted to him saying he is "clever"/ smart /wise.</p>
