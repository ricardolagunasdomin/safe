            <p>Serial Experiments Lain is one of the most interesting pieces of media that I have ever come across. The show has a very mysterious and bizarre plot that is very appealing to me, this mysteriousness is what caught my attention in the first place. </p>
            <p>Serial Experiments Lain is a Japanese anime, that originally aired in July of 1998 up until September of that year. The main character Lain Iwakura is a middle school girl that is very shy, she is introduced to a place called the "wired" when some of her peers begin to receive emails from a deceased classmate. She begins to investigate this "wired" place and things in her life begin to become very weird and strange. The Topics go from god being in this "wired" that is accessed through the Internet to aliens. People who view this show often have many theories about what is going on and why these anomalies happen.  </p>
            <p>The show is also known for the sheer amount of products that have been made from the show. From very expensive <a href="https://www.ebay.ca/itm/363872770803?hash=item54b881daf3:g:pvIAAOSwq-1iqHA2" target="_blank">action figures</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">lunch boxes</a>, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/12961451-b%C3%B4a-serial-experiments-lain-Duvet" target="_blank">vinyls</a>, to <a href="https://sel.fandom.com/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain_(video_game)" target="_blank">video games</a>. Most people that have watched Serial Experiments Lain consider it to be among one of the best shows they have ever seen. And I completely understand why, it seems that almost everything about the show is well thoughtout from the "iconic" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp5ENQ81SYw" target="_blank">character designs</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/serialexperimentslainost" target="_blank"></a>soundtrack(the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm9zAtaxwxg" target="_blank">opening song</a> is also very notorious), and visuals to the buzzing almost from electricity that can be heard during certian parts throughout the show.</p>
